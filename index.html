                Hello, my name is James Gerstenberger and I am currently studying to become a software developer.
                I am passionate about science, nature and animals and love sports. I especially love soccer and am a big fan of the Premier League
                team Arsenal. Go Gunners!
            </p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I earned my degree in Behavioral Neuroscience from Western Washington University and was fortunate to be able to work
                with the incredible faculty there.
            </p>

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>
                After graduating in 2015, I was employed by Alder Biopharmaceuticals. Alder was based in Bothell and developed monoclonal antibodies
                to help those who suffer from migraines. This position allowed me to really hone my skills in a lab setting. Following my role
                with Alder I moved into the cannabis industry, specifically research and development and intellectual property creation for DeepCell Industries. 
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                In general I strive to be a good person and to be there for my friends and family. With everything going on in the world right now
                my main goal is to become a software developer so I can be financially stable and help contribute to the world in a positive way.
            </p>
